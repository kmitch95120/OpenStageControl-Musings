# OpenStageControl-Musings

This is a place for me to share some things I'm doing or have done with [Open Stage Control](https://openstagecontrol.ammd.net). I was recently introduced to Open Stage Control or O-S-C; not to be confused with OSC [Open Sound Control](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/groups/osc).

O-S-C is server-based so it runs on a centralized computer and presents a client UI interface via a web browser. This was intriguing to me since I already use an always on computer in my show network. Currently that is a [Raspberry Pi 400](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/).

More to come...
